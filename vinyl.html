Vinyl cutting is the process of contour cutting vinyl.  The vinyl application can be used for many purposes including signs, stickers, van decals and much more.   CTIC has several machines capable of cutting vinyl and you will use two of the machines during this unit.   You continue your use of CorelDraw to create the vector file that will be contour cut by the Roland GS-24 Camm 1 vinyl cutter.    
We will also use the Roland 540i wide format cutter/ printer to create two different stickers using cut contour.  The Roland 540i is capable of printing posters, stickers and banners.   You will set up your job using CorelDraw and create two multi-color stickers that are contour cut.
